# Carbon-Emissions
4-weeks Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Oct 2025 - Nov 2025)

##  Project Status: 30% Completed

The Carbon Emissions Predictor is currently in its early development phase. So far, the following milestones have been achieved:

### Completed Tasks
- **Data Ingestion**: Loaded and explored a 10,000-row dataset on global energy consumption
- **Feature Engineering**: Dropped non-predictive columns (`Country`, `Year`) and selected key predictors
- **Data Cleaning**: Verified no missing values across selected features
- **Scaling**: Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize input features
- **Target Isolation**: Defined `Carbon Emissions (Million Tons)` as the prediction target

### Current Focus
- Designing the input-output flow for model prediction
- Preparing training-ready datasets
- Exploring regression models for baseline performance

### Model Goal
Predict a country’s carbon emissions based on:
- Fossil Fuel Dependency (%)
- Renewable Energy Share (%)
- Industrial & Household Energy Use (%)
- Energy Price Index (USD/kWh)
